> Curated list of useful resources for Node-RED.

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

## Nodes

### Analysis

- [node-red-node-badwords](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-nodes/tree/master/analysis/swearfilter) - Analyses the payload and tries to filter out any messages containing bad swear words. This only operates on payloads of type string. Everything else is blocked.
- [node-red-node-wordpos](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-nodes/tree/master/analysis/wordpos) - Analyses the payload and classifies the part-of-speech of each word. The resulting message has msg.pos added with the results. A word may appear in multiple categories (eg, 'great' is both a noun and an adjective).
